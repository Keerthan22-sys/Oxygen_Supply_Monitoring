# Oxygen_Supply_Monitoring
 To automatically supply and cutoff the sufficient amount of oxygen to the patient without manual intervention and accuracy in intervals, calculations based on which the amount of oxygen is supplied.

 By initializing the basic parameters to calculate.

## Input Parameters - Basic

ABG (pH, PaO2, PaCO2, HCO3 and SaO2), PO2 and spO2.
## Input Parameters - Additional
Tidal Volume(TV), Blood Pressure(BP), Mean Arterial Pressure(MAP), and ROX Index.

## Output
It calculates the amount of oxygen(in liter) required based on all the above parameters.

## Further Development in Progress...!!
